# Sudoku Solver

This is a simple implementation of a Sudoku solver. The program solves a given Sudoku puzzle using a backtracking algorithm and prints the solution.

## How to Use

1. Define the Sudoku puzzle you want to solve. The puzzle should be a 9x9 grid where empty cells are represented by 0.
2. Run the program.
3. The program will print the original Sudoku puzzle and the solved puzzle.

## Code Explanation

### Main Functions

1. `print_sudoku(sudoku)`: Prints the Sudoku puzzle in a formatted way.
2. `find_next_empty(puzzle)`: Finds the next empty cell in the Sudoku puzzle.
3. `is_valid(puzzle, guess, row, col)`: Checks if a guessed number is valid in the given row and column.
4. `sudoku_solver(puzzle)`: Solves the Sudoku puzzle using a backtracking algorithm.

### Example Usage

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    sudoku = [
        [1, 0, 7, 0, 0, 6, 4, 5, 0],
        [0, 2, 5, 3, 4, 0, 0, 0, 8],
        [0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 7, 0],
        [0, 5, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 9],
        [6, 1, 0, 0, 0, 9, 8, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 2, 0, 0, 7],
        [0, 0, 1, 0, 9, 3, 2, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 4, 0, 0, 7, 8, 5, 9, 1]
    ]
    
    print_sudoku(sudoku)
    sudoku_solver(sudoku)
    print("--After Solution--")
    print_sudoku(sudoku)
```

### Areas for Improvement

1. **Input Validation**: Ensure that the input Sudoku puzzle is a valid 9x9 grid with numbers between 0 and 9.
2. **Optimized Backtracking**: Implement more advanced techniques to optimize the backtracking algorithm and reduce the solving time.
3. **User Interface**: Create a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more interactive and user-friendly experience.
4. **Error Handling**: Add error handling to manage invalid inputs and unsolvable puzzles.

## Conclusion

This Sudoku solver provides a straightforward approach to solving Sudoku puzzles using a backtracking algorithm. The code can be further improved with input validation, optimization, a user interface, and better error handling.
